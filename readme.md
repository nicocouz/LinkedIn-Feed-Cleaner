## **How It Works**

The extension injects a script into your LinkedIn feed that:

- Applies or removes the CSS style `display: none` depending on your preference.

The state is stored in `localStorage` for a seamless user experience.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Manifest V3**: For Chrome extension configuration.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for DOM manipulation.
- **Inline CSS**: Styles applied directly in the script for simplicity.
